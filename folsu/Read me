This project is a MEAN stack solution to managing inventory at Wider Storage. While I work as a project manager in the construction business
I realized I needed a way to track the inventory of what was in a packing list vs what actually arrived, and what was needed to fulfill a project.
Also added a report section for on site foreman, that can be read by the admin users. 
There is an implemented log in-log out.

It was never implemented company wide, but I did use it succesfully for the projects I managed.
